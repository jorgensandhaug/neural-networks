# Building a neural network from scratch using python.

### This was a weekend project where i built a basic neural network in python from scratch, using only numpy. It works great on the mnist dataset, both with a convolutional approach and by flattening.

## Layers
 - Dense
 - Convolutional
 - Reshape
 - Logger

## Loss functions
- MeanSquaredError
- CrossEntropy

## Activation functions
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
- Relu
- Softmax
